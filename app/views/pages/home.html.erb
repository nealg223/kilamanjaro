<p>
  The year is 3523. We have failed as a human society. 
  We were once a society of the Great Builders, craftsmen who chose to create solutions and build lasting institutions for the world to be a better place.
  Unfortunately, we humans chose to become complacent and selfish. However, there is one last hope. An old myth describes a place called Code Mountain, the legendary source of Rubies and where Rails was founded.
  But how will we get there? By learning Ruby on Rails.
